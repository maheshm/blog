Today has been a day which reminded me a lot about my school days, in several ways. One of it was the Sanskrit class in which my sir teased me saying I should stop learning in the conventional schools and should go and attend some Vedic classes! 

I had been reading some book the day before and was kind of stuck with lots of doubts, so many that I couldnt figure out what all were my doubts! And in the Sanskrit hour sir came and I was reading some part in the text that he was taking and all of a sudden I felt as if I was struck with some words in the passage and it seemed as if all my doubts were surrounding just two words: Karanam and Hetu. I asked my sir, is there any difference between the two. He kind of got exactly what I was asking and probably knew that it was not right time to answer my query. I wouldnt have understood also. Some day I had figured out that they are different. 

Karanam is cause and it has a reason which leads to it and there is an activeness associated with it, while hetu is more passive where in it itself is the cause.
