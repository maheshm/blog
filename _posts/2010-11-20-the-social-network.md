A good movie that shows how a guy can get screwed up by starting a billion dollar worth company. I dont know if you can do it, but I could draw some inspiration out of it. And I am feeling good. Energised again. A motivation to do something. To tell someone: " I am the CEO, bitch"! :)

A feeling only Entrepreneurs can feel perhaps! Google, what am I searching for. Lets wait and see.. ;)
