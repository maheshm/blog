title: Stuck with Google Maps
created: 1316761726

I have been stuck with a google maps issue for few days. There are 3 tabs and one is that of google maps. When the jQuery tabify is not used I can see the map properly. But when it is tabified it doesnt show up properly. The grey area is more prominent. I saw a comment saying resize event when triggered manually(it triggers only on manual intervension!!) the size get adjusted. I tried that. But that didnt help either.

Posted it to stackoverflow.
