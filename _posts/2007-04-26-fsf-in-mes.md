Finally an introductory meeting on FSF was conducted in MES, Kuttipuram. Jinesh was the key speaker. He inspired the S4 students of CS and IT. Surprisingly some girls also turned up. A Debian Etch Release party is being planned. Hoping to get an active team. Some of the guys in IT are doing some work in ReactOS. Fully supported and guided by the great C.K.Raju Sir.
