This is a joint work by me and my mom, Latha Mukundan. It gave her her MPhil!

Its an extension to the existing TSP, giving more importance to the time domain, as the title suggests.

ABSTRACT
---
In usual TSP the weights are assumed to be constant. But in most practical cases like in modelling road travel as TSP, the weights are never a constant. It is always a function of time. A method for solving the TSP in such situation is proposed here. The time of departure and arrival of the traveller must also be included in problem. The problem gets further complicated when we do not assume that there is no cost for the wait period between the time of arrival and departure. Further it is also shown that this can be adopted to various extensions of the TSP like asymmetric TSP.

Let me see if I can provide the entire doc out here.
