It was a great day for me. Compat wireless was a name I had heard few days back. Its a project that aims at bringing in all the wireless drivers together. It brings in a great CLI concept, wl, that allows you to communicate with driver directly. Its a cool thing that overtakes iwspy. It has better and more meaningful commands as well as better output. I will post more about it soon.
