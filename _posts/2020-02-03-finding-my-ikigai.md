title: Finding my Ikigai
---

I started reading this book about Ikigai yesterday. Pretty good start I would say. I wanted to do a quick reality check on where I am and this post is more in that direction - trying to figure out how I will find my Ikigai.

I will first list down all the threads that are running in my life and see where I am with each. That would give me better idea on what I want/missing and what I need to improve. I was discussing with Megha the other day on whether I would like to continue in the tech industry at all or not. I hope I will get some clarity towards the end of the book.

1. Music - Mridangam, Carnatic Vocal
2. Health - Gym (have to be consistent), Cycling (need a cyclic plan), No sugar (going good), reduce carbs
3. Cooking - Recently started experimenting (low carb, high protien), would love to do more
4. Reading - Just started with Ikigai, have 3 books in pipeline (The book of why, two in Physics) and would love to pick up the 6 books that Megha already finished this year! Will plan for 1 per month
5. Science - B612, I would like to ramp it up
6. Business - Sahlangana, Wanderlogs (get it out of hibernation), debunk.news (evaluate futher, get it out of hibernation), identity stuff (not sure if i should spend time there), South Indian Restaurant in Berlin (feasibility study)
7. Wealth - Stock, Mutual funds, Bitcoin, real estate. Investigate similar markets in Berlin
8. Writing - Short stories, tech (almost dead thread)
