"Its been sometime since I have blogged something" is a sentence that I may repeatedly use throughout my blog! Its true but anyone can find it by a simple glance on the dates. But yeah, its a nice way to begin.

Life was taking me to a lot of places. I was an employer for about six months after completing my BTech. And now here I stand as an employee of Webyana. Its been like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gam till now, a pattern that repeats itself throughout life.

Life at Webyana is nice. I got to learn a lot of things. Especially technology-wise. I now know Ruby on Rails, CouchDB, HTML5 and what not! Will have to add some sample codes and experiences into the blog and GitHub. Trying to get some spare time.

Here in Bangalooru the climate rocks! Simply awesome. It been nearly three months that I am here. Wow, time is going fast.
