It was fun and a bit troublesome to work with GDK and GTK. The Computer Graphics and Multimedia paper in our syllabus is quite a good guide indeed. The irony is, I still have not drawn anything :)

The tutorials are kind of much more focused. Not yet found the right "Beginners tutorial". Search terms are really important indeed.
