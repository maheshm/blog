excerpt: I found it interesting to know that ADSL modem can be used via USB in GNU/Linux.
  I was told that its tough. Yes, indeed its tough. But its possible. For eg, my Siemens
  modem use GlobeSpan chipset. The USB driver for the same for GNU/Linux is available
  for download and appriciable work is being done in this direction. The configuration
  seemed a bit too geeky, but a small effort can help a user to setup the modem and
  use it via USB.<br /><br />Well anyway, its always better to use modem via LAN card!!
