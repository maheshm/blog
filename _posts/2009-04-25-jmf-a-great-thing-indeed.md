excerpt: Though I do not  like Java, I found JMF an interesting thing. It does a lot
  of things by itself. Basically it has a MediaLocator, that helps in assigning either
  source or destination of the media. Then a processor that processes the media, determines
  its format, frame rate, conversion to target format, etc. Then what I know is about
  the transmitter. It helps in transmitting the data, for eg, using RTP. There are
  also media players that help to control the media flow. Now all these reduses the
  effort we would have to put in otherwise.<br />

The framework even gives you the power to control tracks..
