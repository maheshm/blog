excerpt: '<div style="text-align:justify;">GDK really sucks man! Cairo is the best.
  I''m not yet sure whether they can be compared, in the sense that they may be considered
  in the same category. But anyway cairo is the best drawing library that I have ever
  seen. They are as simple as Python programming and, as is Python, you can do wonders
  with simple code. More on cairo also soon.. And mind you: ITS C AND NOT CPP. I had
  a bit confusion. Thinking that its CPP I had initially neglected Cairo which I regret
  now.</div>'
