excerpt: Today is the day when Thrissur just wakes up to full strech. Sample fireworks
  were displayed two days back. It  seems that was not upto the expectation of the
  people. As a matter of fact it attracts  people from all over kerala, especially
  the  firework. Early morning tomorrow at about 4am a much awaited firework display,
  famous for its sound, will be there.<br />Supreme court had interfered in the proper
  conduct of the pooram. Many restriction are being planned. Once they are imposed,
  the whole senario of the Pooram will change. Hope it will not be so.
