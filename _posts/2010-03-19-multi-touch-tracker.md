A tracker that can be used as the driver for multi-touch implementations was coded in Python. The code uses a lot of functions from OpenCV. It can find upto 50 touches. The algorithm was tuned to obtain minimum CPU usage. It sends these data as a TUIO message to a local port. This later part was done with help of Sreeraj.

This requires that the camera be detected in the system and is accessible for Python. For some cameras, it thus required us to be root.
